# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Abdulsalam! 
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate full-stack developer specializing in Vue.js and Laravel. I love creating visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.

I'm a software engineering intern at Edutams, constantly learning and evolving in this ever-changing tech world.

I am committed to web development, having built a strong foundation in HTML and CSS for creating responsive websites. I have since expanded my expertise to include JavaScript and frameworks like Vue.js for developing dynamic user interfaces.

On the back-end, I work with PHP, Laravel, and databases such as MySQL and SQL to create robust web applications. This combination of front-end and back-end skills allows me to deliver seamless, end-to-end web solutions.

I am dedicated to continuous learning to keep up with modern web development trends, ensuring that I deliver clean, efficient, and user-friendly solutions for every project.
